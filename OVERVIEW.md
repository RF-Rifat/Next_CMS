# NX-CMS Project Overview

## 1. Introduction

NX-CMS is a modern, headless Content Management System (CMS) built using the Next.js framework. It is designed to be a flexible and extensible platform for managing and delivering content for web applications. The backend is powered by Node.js and MongoDB, providing a robust foundation for content storage and retrieval.

## 2. Current Progress

The initial phase of development has focused on establishing a clean and scalable project structure. We have successfully set up the foundational folder architecture within the Next.js `app` directory.

The core achievement so far is the logical separation of concerns for different user roles:

*   **Admin Panel (`/app/nx-admin`)**: A comprehensive folder structure has been created to house all the administrative features. This includes dedicated sections for managing pages, posts, users, media, layouts, and system settings.
*   **User Account (`/app/account`)**: A dedicated area for registered users to manage their profiles, posts, and settings.
*   **Public Frontend (`/app/(frontend)`)**: The structure for the public-facing website that will consume and display the content managed through the CMS.

**Important Note:** While the folder structure is in place, it is crucial to understand that **no actual features have been implemented yet**. The current state is a skeleton that paves the way for future development.

## 3. Folder Structure Highlights

The project's frontend architecture is organized as follows:

- **`app/`**: The main directory for all application routes and logic.
  - **`nx-admin/`**: Contains all routes and views for the administration panel. This is where CMS administrators will manage the site's content and settings. The structure is prepared for features like:
    - `page/`, `post/`: Content creation and management.
    - `users/`: User and role management.
    - `layouts/`: Page layout and template building.
    - `media/`: The media library.
    - `setting/`: Global CMS configuration.
  - **`account/`**: Routes for logged-in users to manage their specific content and profile.
  - **`(frontend)/`**: Contains the routes for the public-facing website. It's set up to handle dynamic content rendering from the CMS.
  - **`api/`**: Houses all the backend API endpoints that will power the CMS, from user authentication to content fetching.

- **`components/`**: This directory holds all the reusable React components.
  - **`admin/`**: Components specifically designed for the admin dashboard.
  - **`layouts/`**: Components related to the visual layout builder.
  - **`ui/`**: General-purpose UI components like buttons, forms, and tables.

## 4. Remaining Tasks & Future Development

The primary task ahead is to build out the functionality for the features outlined in the folder structure. This includes:

- Implementing the backend logic for all API endpoints.
- Building the UI and functionality for all sections of the Admin Panel.
- Developing the user account pages.
- Connecting the frontend to the API to display content dynamically.
- Implementing a robust authentication and authorization system for different user roles (regular user, admin, super-admin).

## 5. How to Add New Features

The modular structure is designed to make adding new features straightforward. A typical workflow would be:

1.  **Define the Database Schema**: Add a new model definition in the `nx/` directory (e.g., for a "Products" feature).
2.  **Create API Endpoints**: Add new route handlers in the `app/api/` directory to handle CRUD operations for the new feature.
3.  **Build Admin UI**: Create new pages and components under `app/nx-admin/` to provide an interface for managing the new feature (e.g., an "Add Product" form).
4.  **Render on Frontend**: If necessary, create corresponding pages in `app/(frontend)/` to display the new content to the public.

## 6. Subscription Model

Access to the admin panel and its powerful content management capabilities will be offered on a subscription basis. Upon subscribing, users will gain full access to the CMS, allowing them to unlock the platform's complete potential for managing their web projects. 

## 7. Development Roadmap

The next phase of development involves bringing the planned features to life. The focus will be on building out the core functionalities of the CMS, following these key steps:

1.  **Backend API Implementation**:
    *   Develop and implement the logic for all API endpoints located in `app/api/`. This includes CRUD operations for posts, pages, users, media, and settings.
    *   Establish database connections and define data models/schemas in the `nx/` directory.

2.  **Authentication & Authorization**:
    *   Implement a secure authentication system for user login and registration.
    *   Create a role-based authorization mechanism to manage permissions for different user types (e.g., admin, user, super-admin).

3.  **Admin Panel UI/UX**:
    *   Build the user interface and interactive components for all sections of the Admin Panel (`app/nx-admin/`).
    *   This includes creating forms for content creation (pages, posts), tables for displaying data, and settings pages.

4.  **User Account Features**:
    *   Develop the frontend and backend for user account management pages under `app/account/`, allowing users to manage their profiles and content.

5.  **Frontend Integration**:
    *   Connect the public-facing frontend (`app/(frontend)/`) to the newly created backend APIs.
    *   Implement dynamic rendering of pages and posts managed through the CMS.
